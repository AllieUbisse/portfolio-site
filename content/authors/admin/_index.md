:star: I'm a Data Scientist, with **strong computer science background** and graduated in 2020 from Explore Data Science Academy. My day to day work revolves around **building Data Pipelines, Machine Learning models** for various interseting problem use cases and deploying them to production. In my free time I like to watch data science talks, listen to Podcast on how other data scientist tackles data problems, read blogs, Hiking, and mostly **participate in online Machine Learning hackathons from the Zindi platform.**

âš¡ **Amazing people, amazing things!** I have learnt alot from Explore Data Science Academy, which includes agile workflow, working as a team in an open space-enviroment or remotely, leading a data science project to production, dealing with pressure & deadlines, learning on the go and lastly communicating findings to/with stackholders. I do not see myself as a hard-worker or smart as my peers would say! I just happen love what I do and keen to work as a team. 

 :joy: Fun fact: **I told Github; the cloud is my friend! I have issues of breaking code during experiments and I'm commited to Linux Terminal, hence Troi + Linux = Troinux.** <br/>
Do not take my word for it, invite me for a chat or let us collaborate on the next innovative project!
